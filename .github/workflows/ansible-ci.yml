# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Ansible CI

# Run when creating PR to master

  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

          #   --parseable-severity  parseable output including severity of rule
          #   -r RULESDIR           specify one or more rules directories using one or
          #                         more -r arguments. Any -r flags override the default
          #                         rules in ansiblelint/rules, unless -R is also used.
          #   -R                    Use default rules in ansiblelint/rules in addition to
          #                         any extra
          #                         rules directories specified with -r. There is no need
          #                         to specify this if no -r flags are used
          #   -t TAGS               only check rules whose id/tags match these values
          #   -x SKIP_LIST          only check rules whose id/tags do not match these
          #                         values
          #   --nocolor             disable colored output

          #                         repeatable.
          #   -c C                  Specify configuration file to use. Defaults to ".ansible-lint"
          #
          # Fix these issues and then remove exclusions!
